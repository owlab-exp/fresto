fresto
======

Fresto is a platform for application performance monitoring and analytics.
This repository is for main monitoring application development. However this can be empty for a while. Because of distributed development nature, 
there are several interim repositories and all of those should be combined to get a working system.

Those repositories are currently following:


* https://github.com/owlab/fresto-aum.git
* https://github.com/owlab/fresto-front.git
* https://github.com/owlab/fresto-ui.git
* https://github.com/owlab/fresto-channel.git
