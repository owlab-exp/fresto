fresto
======

Fresto is a platform for application performance monitoring and analytics.
This repository is for main monitoring application development. However this can be empty some time. Because of distributed development nature, 
there are several interim repositories and all of those should be combined to get a working system.

Those repositories are currently following:


* https://github.com/owlab/fresto-aum.git
* https://github.com/owlab/fresto-front.git
* https://github.com/owlab/fresto-ui.git
* https://github.com/owlab/fresto-channel.git
* https://github.com/owlab/fresto-noti.git
* https://github.com/owlab/fresto-test.git
